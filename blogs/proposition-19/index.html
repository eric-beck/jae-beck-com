			<h1>Proposition 19</h1>
			<p>
				Proposition 19 is a new law that was approved by California voters in November 2020. It allows
				homeowners who are 55 or older, disabled, or victims of natural disasters to transfer their property tax
				base to a new home of equal or lesser value anywhere in the state. This can result in significant tax
				savings for eligible homeowners who want to move to a different location or downsize their living space.
			</p>
			<p>
				We will explain how Proposition 19 works, what are the benefits and drawbacks of using it, and how to
				apply for it. We will also answer some frequently asked questions about this law and provide some
				resources for further information.
			</p>
			<h2>How does Proposition 19 work?</h2>
			<p>
				Proposition 19 replaces the previous rules that allowed homeowners to transfer their property tax base
				only within the same county or to a participating county, and only once in their lifetime. Under
				Proposition 19, homeowners can transfer their property tax base up to three times, and to any county in
				California. The new home must be purchased or newly constructed within two years of selling the original
				home.
			</p>
			<p>
				The amount of the property tax base transfer depends on the value of the new home compared to the old
				one. If the new home is of equal or lesser value than the old one, the property tax base will be
				transferred in full. If the new home is of greater value than the old one, the property tax base will be
				adjusted upward by the difference in value.
			</p>
			<p>
				For example, if a homeowner sells their old home for $500,000 and buys a new one for $600,000, and their
				property tax base is $200,000, then their new property tax base will be $200,000 + ($600,000 - $500,000)
				= $300,000.
			</p>
			<p>
				Proposition 19 also changes the rules for inherited properties. Previously, children or grandchildren
				who inherited a primary residence from their parents or grandparents could keep the low property tax
				base of the original owner, regardless of whether they lived in the home or not. Under Proposition 19,
				inherited properties will be reassessed at market value unless the heirs use them as their primary
				residence within one year of inheritance.
			</p>
			<h2>What are the benefits and drawbacks of Proposition 19?</h2>
			<p>
				The main benefit of Proposition 19 is that it gives more flexibility and affordability to homeowners who
				want to relocate within California. It can help seniors, disabled people, and disaster victims to find a
				more suitable home for their needs and preferences, without facing a huge increase in their property
				taxes. It can also encourage more mobility and turnover in the housing market, which can increase the
				supply and availability of homes for sale.
			</p>
			<p>
				The main drawback of Proposition 19 is that it reduces the tax benefits for inherited properties. It can
				make it more difficult and expensive for heirs to keep their family homes or use them as rental
				properties. It can also result in higher property taxes for some homeowners who move to more expensive
				areas or buy more expensive homes.
			</p>
			<h2>How to apply for Proposition 19?</h2>
			<p>
				To take advantage of Proposition 19, homeowners must file a claim with the county assessor where their
				new home is located within three years of purchasing or completing construction of the new home. They
				must also provide proof of age, disability, or disaster victim status, as well as proof of residency in
				both the old and new homes. The county assessor will then determine the eligibility and amount of the
				property tax base transfer.
			</p>
			<p>
				Homeowners can find more information and forms on the website of the California State Board of
				Equalization (BOE), which oversees the administration of Proposition 19. The BOE also provides a list of
				county assessors' offices and contact information.
