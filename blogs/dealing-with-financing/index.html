			<h1>Dealing with Financing</h1>
			<p>
				As the events of the last few years in the real estate industry show, people forget about the tremendous
				fiscal responsibility of purchasing a home at their peril. Here are a few tips for dealing with the
				dollar signs so that you can take down that “for sale” sign on your new home.
			</p>
			<h2>Get pre-approved</h2>
			<p>
				Sub-primes may be history, but you’ll still be shown homes you can’t afford. By
				getting pre-approved as a buyer, you can save yourself the grief of looking at houses you can't afford.
				You can also put yourself in a better position to make a serious offer when you do find the right house.
				Unlike pre-qualification, which is based on a cursory review of your finances, pre-approval from a
				lender is based on your actual income, debt, and credit history. By doing a thorough analysis of your
				actual spending power, you’ll be less likely to get in over your head.
			</p>
			<h2>Choose your mortgage carefully</h2>
			<p>
				Used to be the emphasis when it came to mortgages was on paying them off
				as soon as possible. Today, the debt the average person will accumulate due to credit cards, student
				loans, etc. means it’s better to opt for the 30-year mortgage instead of the 15-year. This way, you have
				a lower monthly payment, with the option of paying an additional principal when the money is good.
				Additionally, when picking a mortgage, you usually have the option of paying additional points (a
				portion of the interest that you pay at closing) in exchange for a lower interest rate. If you plan to
				stay in the house for a long time—and given the current real estate market, you should—taking the points
				will save you money.
			</p>
			<h2>Do your homework before bidding</h2>
			<p>
				Before you make an offer on a home, do some research on the sales
				trends of comparable homes in the neighborhood with sites like Zillow. Consider especially sales of
				comparable homes in the last three months. For instance, if homes have recently sold for 5 percent less
				than the asking price, your opening bid should be about 8 to 10 percent lower than what the seller is
				asking.
