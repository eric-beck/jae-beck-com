			<h1>5 Tips for Buying a Home</h1>
			<p>Looking to buy a home? Here are five essential tips for making the process as smooth as possible.
			</p>
			<h2>Get your finances in order</h2>
			<p>
				Start by getting a full picture of your credit. Obtain copies of your credit report. Make sure the facts
				are correct and fix any problems you find. Next, find a suitable lender and get pre-approved for a loan.
				This will put you in a better position to make a serious offer when you do find the right house.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Find a house you can afford
			</h2>
			<p>
				As with engagement rings, there’s a general rule of thumb when it comes to buying a home: two-and-a-half
				times your annual salary. There are also several tools and calculators online that can help you
				understand how your income, debt, and expenses affect what you can afford. Don’t forget, too, that there
				are lots of considerations beyond the sticker price, including property taxes, energy costs, etc.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Hire a professional
			</h2>
			<p>
				While the Internet gives buyers unprecedented access to home listings and resources, many aspects of the
				buying process require a level of expertise you can’t pick up from surfing the web. That’s why you’re
				better off using a professional agent than going it alone. If possible, recruit an exclusive buyer
				agent, who will have your interests at heart and can help you with strategies during the bidding
				process.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Do your homework
			</h2>
			<p>
				Before making a bid, do some research to determine the state of the market at large. Is it more
				favorable for sellers or buyers? Next, look at sales trends of comparable homes in the area or
				neighborhood. Look at prices for the last few months. Figure an asking price that’s competitive, but
				also realistic. Otherwise, you may end up ticking off your seller.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Think long term
			</h2>
			<p>
				Obviously, you shouldn’t buy unless you’re sure you’ll be staying put for at least a few years. Beyond
				that, you should buy in a neighborhood with good schools. Whether you have children or not, this will
				have an impact on your new home’s resale value down the line. When it comes to the house itself, you
				should hire your own home inspector, who can point out potential problems that could require costly
				repairs in the future.</p>
