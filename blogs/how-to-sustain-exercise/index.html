			<h1>How to Sustain Exercise</h1>
			<p>
				One of the most common resolutions for the new year is to exercise more and improve one's health and
				fitness. Exercise is one of the best things you can do for your health and well-being. It can help you
				prevent chronic diseases, improve your mood, boost your energy, and enhance your quality of life.
				However, many people struggle to stick to their goals and end up giving up or losing motivation. How can
				one avoid this and start off the new year's with exercise in a sustainable and effective way? Here are
				some tips to help you get started:
			</p>
			<h2>Set realistic and specific goals</h2>
			<p>
				Having a clear and attainable goal can help you focus on what you want to achieve and why. For example,
				instead of saying "I want to lose weight", you could say "I want to lose 10 pounds in 3 months by
				exercising 3 times a week for 30 minutes". This way, you can measure your progress and adjust your plan
				if needed.
			</p>
			<h2>Choose an activity that you enjoy and that suits your lifestyle</h2>
			<p>
				If you hate running, don't force yourself to do it. Find something that you like, such as swimming,
				dancing, cycling, playing sports, or yoga. If you have a busy schedule, look for ways to incorporate
				exercise into your daily routine, such as taking the stairs, walking to work, doing some stretches in
				the morning, or walking your dog(s). The more you like what you do, the more likely you are to stick
				with it.
			</p>
			<h2>Schedule your exercise sessions</h2>
			<p>
				Treat your exercise time as an important appointment that you can't miss. Put it on your calendar, set a
				reminder, and plan ahead for any potential obstacles. For example, if you know that you have a busy day
				ahead, you could exercise in the morning or pack your workout clothes and go to the gym after work.
			</p>
			<h2>Find a buddy or a group to exercise with</h2>
			<p>
				Having someone to support you and hold you accountable can make a big difference in your motivation and
				commitment. You can also make it more fun and social by joining a class, a club, or an online community.
			</p>
			<h2>Join a sporting team or club.</h2>
			<p>
				By participating on a sporting team or club you can enjoy the guidance and scheduling set forth by an
				experienced coach or fellow member and the motivation of friendly competition. You can learn new skills,
				make new friends, and have fun while exercising. Sporting activities are very diverse and vary greatly
				on the intensity and commitment. Here are some ideas on sporting activities:
			</p>
			<p>
				Tennis/pickleball, swimming/water polo, softball, basketball, flag football, sailing, surfing, fishing,
				snow skiing, water skiing, ice hocky/roller hocky, outrigger canoeing, and many other options are
				available in Orange County.
			</p>
			<h2>Reward yourself for your achievements</h2>
			<p>
				Celebrate your milestones and successes by treating yourself to something that makes you happy, such as
				a movie, a massage, or a new outfit or vacation. Just make sure that your rewards are not
				counterproductive to your goals, such as binge eating or drinking.
			</p>
			<h2>Be flexible and forgiving</h2>
			<p>
				Don't beat yourself up if you miss a workout or have a bad day. Remember that you are human and that
				setbacks are normal and expected. Instead of giving up, learn from your mistakes and get back on track
				as soon as possible.
