			<h1>Relocating to the Big City</h1>
			<p>Moving from a small town or suburb to a large city can be an intimidating proposition. Here are a few
				tips to help make your move as painless as possible.
			</p>
			<h2>Research before you move</h2>
			<p>
				It’s important to understand the culture you’re joining. Do research online
				and find out about school systems, neighborhoods, parking, weather, public transportation, and laws that
				are native to that area. If you can, visit a city before moving and connect with someone who’s lived
				there before.
			</p>
			<h2>Have a plan</h2>
			<p>
				There are a lot of steps to go through before you start packing the moving truck. Find
				housing before you leave, or at least know where you’ll stay while you look for a home. Never sign a
				lease on an apartment that you haven’t seen. If you can’t get there, find a friend or an employer to
				check for you. Have a job waiting for you, or if that’s not possible, know what you’ll do for money in
				the first few weeks of living there. Try to line up things like driver’s licenses, car insurance,
				renter’s insurance, and parking passes ahead of time as well.
			</p>
			<h2>Get involved</h2>
			<p>
				Meeting people in a big city can be daunting. Don’t expect the neighbors to knock your
				door down with a casserole when you arrive: city life is often too noisy and hectic. Take the
				initiative. If there are things you like to do in your town, find ways to do those things in the city.
				Try new things. Volunteer. Big cities offer so many opportunities to engage other people, so find what
				you like.
			</p>
			<h2>Mind your wallet</h2>
			<p>
				City life is expensive. Everything costs more: food, insurance, clothes, rent. There
				are also a lot more ways to get ripped off, whether legally or criminally. Be careful how you spend and
				know where your money is going.</p>
