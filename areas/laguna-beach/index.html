					<h2>History</h2>
					<p>
						Prehistoric Laguna Beach
						Laguna Beach was the site of a prehistoric Paleoindian civilization. In 1933, the first
						fossilized skull of a Paleoindian found in California was uncovered during construction on St.
						Ann's Drive. Known as "Laguna Woman", the skull originally was radiocarbon dated to more than
						17,000 years ago, but revised measurements suggest it originated during the Holocene era, 11,700
						years ago. Subsequent research has found several prehistoric encampment sites in the area.

						The first inhabitants of Laguna Beach were the Tongva people, who lived in villages along the
						coast and in the canyons. They depended on fresh water, game, and marine life for survival. They
						also traded with other native groups in Southern California.

						Spanish and Mexican Era
						The first European explorer to visit the area was Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo, who sailed along the
						west coast of California for Spain in 1542. He named the region "California" after a mythical
						island in a Spanish novel. Later, Sir Francis Drake explored the area for England in 1579.

						In 1769, Gaspar de Portola led a Spanish expedition that followed El Camino Real from San Diego
						to San Francisco. He crossed Aliso Creek, which marks the southern boundary of Laguna Beach. In
						1776, Mission San Juan Capistrano was founded by Saint Junipero Serra, a Franciscan priest. The
						mission converted many of the Tongva people to Christianity and taught them agriculture and
						crafts.

						In 1818, Hippolyte de Bouchard, a French Argentine sailor, plundered San Juan Capistrano and
						earned the reputation of "California's only pirate" of those days. Legend says he buried booty
						on the Laguna coast.

						In 1821, Mexico gained independence from Spain and took control of California. The mission lands
						were secularized and granted to Mexican citizens as ranchos. The area that is now Laguna Beach
						was part of Rancho San Joaquin and Rancho Niguel.

						American Settlement
						In 1846, the Mexican-American War began and ended with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848,
						which ceded California to the United States. The first American settlers arrived in Laguna Beach
						in the 1870s. They were mostly homesteaders, cattle ranchers, and sheep herders. They also
						planted orchards and crops such as barley and beans.

						The first house in Laguna Beach was built by George and Sarah Thurston in Arch Beach, just north
						of Bluebird Canyon, in 1871. They had seven children and were among the founders of the Laguna
						Beach School District in 1891. The first post office was established in 1887 with George
						Thurston as the postmaster.

						The first hotel in Laguna Beach was built by Joseph Yoch in 1886. It was called the Hotel Yoch
						and later renamed Hotel Laguna. It attracted visitors who enjoyed fishing, hunting, swimming,
						and boating. The hotel also hosted dances and social events.

						Artistic Development
						Laguna Beach became a popular destination for artists in the early 20th century. They were drawn
						by the natural beauty, mild climate, and diverse landscape of the city. They also found
						inspiration from the local culture and history.

						Some of the early artists who settled or visited Laguna Beach were Norman St. Clair, William
						Wendt, Anna Hills, Frank Cuprien, Edgar Payne, Clarence Hinkle, and Guy Rose. They formed art
						associations and clubs to promote their work and organize exhibitions. They also taught art
						classes and workshops to aspiring artists.

						One of the most famous events in Laguna Beach's artistic history is the Pageant of the Masters,
						which began in 1933 as part of the Festival of Arts. The Pageant is a live performance that
						recreates famous artworks using real people as models. It is held every summer at an outdoor
						amphitheater.

						Another notable event is the Sawdust Art Festival, which started in 1966 as a protest against
						the juried system of the Festival of Arts. The Sawdust features local artists who display and
						sell their original creations made from various media such as wood, glass, metal, ceramics,
						textiles, and more.

						Other art events that take place in Laguna Beach are Art-A-Fair, Bluewater Music Festival,
						Kelpfest, Plein Air Painting Invitational, and Laguna Art Museum exhibitions.

						Modern Laguna Beach
						Laguna Beach has grown from a small village to a city of over 23,000 residents. It has
						maintained its charm and character by preserving its historic buildings, protecting its natural
						resources, and supporting its artistic community.

						The city has adopted the council-manager form of government since 1944. The city council
						consists of five members elected at large who serve four-year terms. The mayor and mayor pro tem
						are chosen by the council from among themselves. The city manager is appointed by the council
						and oversees the administration of the city.

						The city has remained isolated from urban encroachment by its surrounding hills, limited highway
						access, and dedicated greenbelt. The Laguna Beach coastline is protected by 5.88 miles of state
						marine reserve and an additional 1.21 miles of state conservation area.

						Tourism is the primary industry in Laguna Beach, with an estimated six million people visiting
						the city annually. The city offers a variety of attractions and activities for visitors, such as
						beaches, parks, trails, galleries, shops, restaurants, and nightlife.

						Laguna Beach is a city that celebrates its history, culture, and environment. It is a place
						where art and nature coexist in harmony. It is a place where people can enjoy the beauty and
						diversity of life.
