					<h2>History</h2>
					<p>
						Newport Beach's history begins with the Tongva people, who lived on the land for thousands of
						years in a thriving community. The Tongva villages of Genga and Moyongna were located in Newport
						Beach, and they were the traditional caretakers of the land . The Tongva culture was disrupted
						by the arrival of European explorers and colonizers in the 1500s and 1600s, who mapped the coast
						and claimed the land for Spain and later Mexico. In 1801, Newport Beach was part of the enormous
						land grant of Don Jos√© Antonio Yorba I, a Spanish soldier who became one of the first settlers
						of California .

						The land remained mostly undeveloped until the late 1800s, when a steamer named The Vaquero,
						captained by Samuel S. Dunnells, navigated through the lower and upper bay of Newport and
						unloaded its cargo. This event sparked the interest of James Irvine, a wealthy landowner who
						owned most of the San Joaquin Ranch, which included Newport Beach. Irvine and his partners
						decided to name the new port "Newport", and began to develop it as a shipping and fishing center
						. The port was also known as McFaddens Landing and Port Orange, after James McFadden, one of
						Irvine's associates who built a wharf and a warehouse on the peninsula .

						Newport Beach soon became a popular destination for tourists and recreational boaters, who
						enjoyed its sandy beaches, mild climate and scenic views. In 1892, Newport Beach was laid out as
						a town by William S. Collins, a real estate developer who also created Balboa Island by dredging
						sand from the bay . In 1905, the Pacific Electric Railway connected Newport Beach to Los Angeles
						and Long Beach, making it more accessible and attractive to visitors . In 1906, Newport Beach
						became incorporated as a city with about 200 residents .

						In the early 1900s, Newport Beach also became a hotspot for filmmaking, as many silent movies
						were shot on location in its natural settings. Some of the famous actors and directors who
						worked in Newport Beach include Cecil B. DeMille, Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, Buster
						Keaton and John Wayne . The city also attracted many celebrities and wealthy people who built
						their homes and estates on the waterfront or on the hills overlooking the ocean. Some of the
						notable residents of Newport Beach include Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, Shirley Temple,
						Nicolas Cage and Kobe Bryant .

						Newport Beach continued to grow and prosper throughout the 20th century, as it developed into a
						modern city with diverse industries, such as aerospace electronics, health care, education and
						tourism . The city also expanded its boundaries by annexing several neighboring communities,
						such as Corona del Mar, Newport Coast and Newport Mesa . The city also preserved its historical
						and cultural heritage by creating landmarks and museums, such as the Balboa Pavilion (built in
						1906), the Balboa Fun Zone (built in 1936), the Newport Harbor Nautical Museum (founded in 1986)
						and the Newport Beach Historical Society (founded in 1962) .

						Today, Newport Beach is one of the most desirable places to live and visit in California,
						offering a variety of attractions and activities for all ages and interests. Whether you want to
						enjoy surfing, sailing, fishing or swimming on its beaches; explore its wildlife and nature on
						its islands and back bay; shop and dine at its upscale boutiques and restaurants; or learn about
						its history and culture at its museums and landmarks; you will find something to suit your taste
						in Newport Beach.
