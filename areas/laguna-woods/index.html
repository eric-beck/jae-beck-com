			<h1>Laguna Woods, California</h1>
			<p>
				Laguna Woods is a city in Orange County, California, that is home to about 17,000 residents, most of whom are seniors living in a gated retirement community called Laguna Woods Village. Laguna Woods, as a community, began in the 1900s when its four-square miles of gradual and varying slopes, hills, and low-lying areas were a part of South Orange County’s expansive Moulton Ranch. Today, Laguna Woods is a destination for active retiring adults offering seniors many amenities and activities.

					<h2>History</h2>
					<p>
						In 1962, Ross Cortese, a young and energetic developer whose previous projects included Rossmoor and Leisure World Seal Beach, purchased 3,500 acres of Moulton Ranch. His goal was to create a second Leisure World community, “to supply the basic needs of life for people aged 52 and older; create a serene atmosphere of beauty; and provide security, recreation, and religious facilities – then leave the living to the individual.” His dream materialized and on September 10, 1964, Leisure World Laguna Hills (now called Laguna Woods Village) received its first ten residents.

Since then, Laguna Woods Village has grown to be one of the world’s premier retirement communities for active adults. It offers over two hundred clubs and organizations, seven clubhouses, five swimming pools, twenty-seven golf holes, tennis courts, an equestrian center, a performing arts center, and more. It also has its own bus system, security service, library, and newspaper.

Leisure World Laguna Hills was originally an unincorporated area of Orange County under the jurisdiction of the County Board of Supervisors. However, in 1971, the neighboring community of Laguna Hills incorporated as a city and annexed Leisure World as part of its territory. This meant that Leisure World residents had to pay city taxes and fees without having any representation or control over city affairs.

For many years, Leisure World residents tried to gain more autonomy and influence over their community by forming various committees and associations. They also explored the possibility of forming their own city or becoming a special district. However, these efforts were met with resistance from both the County and the City of Laguna Hills.

The situation changed in the late 1990s when two key issues arose that threatened the quality of life and security of Leisure World residents: the potential reduction of municipal services provided by the County due to budget cuts and the possibility of a commercial airport at the site of the former El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. These concerns galvanized Leisure World residents to pursue cityhood to protect their interests and have a stronger voice in regional matters.

Cityhood proponents were successful in gaining the necessary approvals to place the issue of incorporation on the ballot for a special election on March 2, 1999. The measure passed with 86% of the votes in favor. On March 24, 1999, Laguna Woods officially became a city. It was Orange County’s 32nd city and one of California’s safest cities.

Laguna Woods is unique in that about ninety percent of its land area consists of Laguna Woods Village, which is still a private gated community governed by its own boards and corporations. The other ten percent consists of businesses, some homes, and the city hall, which are accessible to the public. The city provides basic services such as public safety, animal control, street maintenance, code enforcement, and recreation programs. The city also participates in regional issues such as transportation planning, environmental protection, and emergency preparedness.

Laguna Woods is a city with a rich history and a vibrant community. It has evolved from a rural ranch land to a world-class retirement destination to a self-governing city with its own identity and vision. It is a place where seniors can enjoy an active and fulfilling lifestyle with many opportunities for socialization, recreation, education, and culture. It is also a place where residents can have a say in their own affairs and make a difference in their surroundings. Laguna Woods is a city that celebrates its past, embraces its present, and looks forward to its future.

Laguna Woods is a city in Orange County, California, that occupies approximately four-square miles of land that was once part of the Moulton Ranch. The city is known for being one of the world's premier retirement communities for active adults, with an average age of 73 among its 18,000 residents.
