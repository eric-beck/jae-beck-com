			<h1>Aliso Viejo, California</h1>

				Aliso Viejo is a city in southern Orange County, California, which has a rich and diverse history. Aliso
				Viejo derives its name from Spanish for "old alder" or "old sycamore", referring to the trees that grow
				along Aliso Creek. The creek was an important source of water and food for the Acjachemen, the
				Indigenous people who lived in the area for thousands of years. Today, Aliso Viejo is a vibrant and
				diverse city that offers a high quality of life to its residents. The city has a young and educated
				population with a high-income level and a low poverty rate. The city also has a rich cultural heritage

					<h2>History</h2>
					<p>
						The Acjachemen were an Indigenous people of California who lived in the coastal areas of what
						are now Orange and San Diego counties. Their ancestral lands extended from Aliso Creek to Las
						Pulgas Canyon. They had a complex social structure, a rich spiritual tradition, and a diverse
						economy based on hunting, fishing, and crafting. They were also known as Juaneños by the Spanish
						colonizers who established Mission San Juan Capistrano near one of their villages, Acjacheme, in
						1776. The mission had a devastating impact on the Acjachemen culture, population, and land
						rights.

						The Acjachemen were displaced by the arrival of Spanish settlers in the 18th century, who
						established missions and ranchos in the region. One of these ranchos was Rancho Niguel, which
						was granted to Juan Avila by the Mexican government in 1842. The rancho covered 22,000 acres of
						land, including what is now Aliso Viejo. Avila was a wealthy cattle rancher who built a large
						adobe house on his property.

						In the 1890s, the Moulton family bought Rancho Niguel from Avila's heirs and renamed it Moulton
						Ranch. The Moulton's were successful sheep ranchers who expanded their land holdings and
						diversified their business ventures. They also built a mansion, a schoolhouse, a post office,
						and a general store on their ranch. The Moulton's were influential in the development of south
						Orange County and contributed to the establishment of roads, railways, water systems and civic
						organizations.

						In 1976, the Mission Viejo Company purchased the remaining 6,600 acres of Moulton Ranch to
						create a new planned community – Aliso Viejo. The company designed a master plan for 20,000
						homes for a projected population of 50,000. The plan also included parks, schools, recreation
						facilities, business centers and open space. The first homes were sold in 1982 and the first
						residents moved in later that year. Aliso Viejo became one of the fastest growing communities in
						Orange County and attracted many corporations and professionals to its location.

						In 2001, Aliso Viejo became Orange County's 34th city after a community vote that showed
						overwhelming support for incorporation. The city adopted a council-manager form of government
						and elected its first mayor and council members. The city also established its own police and
						fire services, public works department and library system. Aliso Viejo continues to be a vibrant
						and dynamic city that offers a high quality of life for its residents and visitors.
