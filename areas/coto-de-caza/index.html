			<h1>Coto de Caza, California</h1>
			<p>
				Coto de Caza is a census-designated place and a private community in Orange County, California. It has a
				population of 14,710 as of 2020 and covers an area of 7.82 square miles. The name means "Hunting
				Reserve" in Spanish, reflecting its history as a hunting lodge and a wildlife sanctuary. The history of
				Coto de Caza can be traced back to the Native Americans who lived in the area known as Rancho Santa
				Margarita. They were called Acjachemen or Juane√±o by the Spanish missionaries who arrived in the 18th
				century. The Acjachemen were hunters and gatherers who lived in villages along the creeks and rivers.
				They also traded with other tribes and coastal peoples.

				In 1843, the Mexican government granted the land of Rancho Santa Margarita to Juan Forster, a British
				citizen who married into a prominent Californio family. Forster used the land for cattle ranching and
				farming until his death in 1882. His heirs sold the land to James L. Flood and Richard O'Neill Sr., two
				Irish immigrants who made their fortune in silver mining. They expanded the ranch to over 200,000 acres
				and became one of the largest landowners in California.

				In 1964, Chevron Corporation acquired a portion of the ranch and partnered with Arvida Corporation to
				develop a planned community. They envisioned a hunting lodge and a country club surrounded by luxury
				homes and golf courses. They named it Coto de Caza, after the Spanish term for a fenced hunting ground.
				The first phase of development began in 1968 with the construction of the lodge, which is now the Lodge
				at Coto de Caza. The lodge hosted celebrities, politicians, and royalty who came to enjoy hunting,
				fishing, and equestrian activities.

				In 1979, Arvida bought out Chevron and hired Richard Boultinghouse as president and general manager of
				Coto de Caza. Boultinghouse had previously developed McCormick Ranch in Scottsdale, Arizona, and applied
				his experience to Coto de Caza. He created a master plan for a community of about 5,000 homes with
				various amenities and neighborhoods. He also preserved the natural beauty and wildlife of the area by
				donating land to the county for a wilderness park.

				In 1983, Orange County approved Coto's master plan and three years later, the community officially
				opened. The first homes were sold in the Village, a neighborhood of custom homes on large lots. Other
				neighborhoods followed, such as Los Ranchos Estates, a rural community of seventy-five large custom
				homes on 355 acres; The Woods, an exclusive enclave of estate homes on wooded lots; and The Trails, a
				gated community of equestrian properties.

				Coto de Caza continued to grow and attract affluent residents throughout the 1980s and 1990s. It also
				became famous for hosting various events, such as the 1984 Olympic pentathlon, the 1992 U.S. Olympic
				equestrian trials, and the 1997 Genesis Invitational golf tournament. In addition, it was featured in
				several movies and TV shows, such as The Real Housewives of Orange County, The OC, and Laguna Beach.

				By 2003, Coto de Caza was completed with about 4,000 homes and two golf courses. It is now one of the
				most prestigious and desirable communities in Orange County, with an average home price of over $1
				million. It offers its residents a high quality of life with security, privacy, recreation, and social
				activities. It also maintains its connection to nature and history with the Thomas F. Riley Wilderness
				Park, which surrounds the community on three sides and serves as a wildlife and plant sanctuary.

				Coto de Caza is a unique place that combines luxury and nature in harmony. It has a rich history that
				spans from Native Americans to modern celebrities. It is a community that values tradition, exclusivity,
				elegance, and adventure. It is more than just a hunting reserve; it is a lifestyle.
