					<h2>History</h2>
					<p>
						The history of Mission Viejo begins with Rancho Mission Viejo, a vast Spanish land grant that
						covered about 200,000 acres of what is now southern Orange County. The land was originally part
						of the Mission San Juan Capistrano, which was founded in 1776 by Spanish friars. However, after
						Mexico gained independence from Spain in 1821, the missions were secularized, and their lands
						were divided among various owners.

						One of these owners was Don Juan Forster, an English-born Mexican ranchero who purchased Rancho
						Mission Viejo in 1845 for $14,000. Forster used the land for cattle and sheep grazing and
						provided horses to the United States military during the Mexican American War. Forster's
						descendants continued to own and operate the ranch until 1963, when they sold it to a group of
						developers led by Donald Bren.

						The developers who bought Rancho Mission Viejo had a grand vision for transforming the hilly and
						rugged terrain into a modern and attractive community. They formed the Mission Viejo Company,
						which was headed by Richard O'Neill Jr., Jerome Moiso, and Anthony Moiso. They hired urban
						planner Donald Bren to design a master plan for the new city, which would be named after the
						original ranch.

						Bren's plan was inspired by the concept of "New Towns", which were planned communities that
						aimed to provide a balanced and integrated environment for living, working, and recreation. Bren
						envisioned Mission Viejo as a city that would preserve the natural beauty and character of the
						land, while offering a variety of housing options, amenities, and services to its residents. He
						also incorporated elements of Spanish architecture and landscaping to reflect the city's
						heritage.

						The Mission Viejo Company began construction of the city in 1965, starting with the development
						of Lake Mission Viejo, a man-made reservoir that would serve as a focal point and recreational
						center for the community. The company also built roads, schools, parks, shopping centers, golf
						courses, and other facilities to support the growing population. The first homes were sold in
						1966, and by 1972, more than 10,000 people lived in Mission Viejo.

						As Mission Viejo continued to expand and prosper, its residents began to express their desire
						for more local control and autonomy over their community. In 1987, they voted to incorporate it
						as a city, becoming the 27th city in Orange County. The city adopted a council-manager form of
						government, with five elected council members and a hired city manager.

						Since its incorporation, Mission Viejo has maintained its reputation as one of the most
						desirable places to live in Orange County and in California. The city has been recognized for
						its high quality of life, low crime rate, excellent schools, abundant parks and trails, diverse
						cultural and recreational opportunities, and strong community spirit. The city has also hosted
						several national and international sporting events, such as the U.S. Olympic Festival in 1989
						and the U.S. Senior Open Golf Championship in 1997.

						Today, Mission Viejo has a population of about 94,000 people and covers an area of eighteen
						square miles. It is mostly residential in nature and culture, but also has some offices and
						businesses. The city is still noted for its tree-lined neighborhoods and its adherence to its
						original master plan. The city's motto is "Make Living Your Mission", which reflects its
						commitment to providing a fulfilling and enriching experience for its residents.
