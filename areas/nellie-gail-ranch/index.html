			<h1>Nellie Gail Ranch, California</h1>
			<p>
				If you are looking for a place to live in Southern California that combines luxury, history, and nature,
				you might want to consider Nellie Gail Ranch. Nellie Gail Ranch is a prestigious equestrian community in
				Laguna Hills, named after a remarkable woman who played a significant role in the development of Orange
				County.

				Nellie Gail Moulton was born in 1878 in Kansas and moved to Nebraska as a child. She became a school
				teacher and later moved to Washington, where she met her future husband, Lewis Moulton. Lewis was a
				successful sheep rancher who owned 22,000 acres of land in what is now Laguna Hills, Laguna Niguel,
				Aliso Viejo, and Laguna Woods. He had bought the land from the Mexican government in 1895 with his
				partner Jean Pierre Daguerre.

				Nellie married Lewis in 1908 and moved to his ranch, where they raised their two daughters, Charlotte
				and Louise. Nellie was not impressed by the dry and barren landscape at first, but she soon learned to
				love it and became an active member of the community. She was involved in many civic and cultural
				organizations, such as the Laguna Beach Art Association, the Ebell Club of Laguna Hills, and the
				Saddleback Valley Historical Society. She was also a talented painter who studied under famous artists
				like William Wendt and Anna Hills.

				Nellie inherited the ranch after Lewis died in 1938 and managed it until 1950, when she transferred it
				to her daughters. The ranch continued to operate as a sheep farm until the 1960s, when urbanization and
				population growth made it more profitable to sell the land for development. The Moulton family sold most
				of their land to various developers, but they kept 1,350 acres for themselves and created Nellie Gail
				Ranch, a master-planned community with large lots, horse trails, and recreational facilities.

				Today, Nellie Gail Ranch is one of the most desirable neighborhoods in Orange County, with homes ranging
				from $2 million to over $10 million. The community offers a variety of amenities for its residents, such
				as a clubhouse, a tennis center, a swim center, an equestrian center, and 26 miles of trails. The
				community also hosts many events throughout the year, such as concerts, picnics, parades, and holiday
				celebrations.

				Nellie Gail Ranch is more than just a place to live; it is a place to celebrate the legacy of Nellie
				Gail Moulton and her family. She was a pioneer, a philanthropist, an artist, and a visionary who helped
				shape the history and culture of Orange County. If you are interested in learning more about Nellie Gail
				Ranch or finding your dream home there, contact us today. We would love to help you discover this
				amazing community.
