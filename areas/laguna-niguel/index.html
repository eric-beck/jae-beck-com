				<h2>Laguna Hills, California</h2>

			<p>Laguna Hills is a city in Orange County, California, that was incorporated
				in 1991. The city derives its name from the rolling hills and proximity to Laguna Canyon and Laguna
				Beach. However, the history of Laguna Hills goes back much further than its incorporation.

					<h3>History</h3>
					<p>
						Laguna Niguel is a city in Orange County, California, that has a rich and diverse history. The
						name of the city comes from the Spanish words for "lagoon" and "Niguili", which was the name of
						a Native American village that once existed near Aliso Creek. The area was originally part of
						the Rancho Niguel land grant, which was given to Juan Avila by the Mexican government in 1842.
						Avila was a rancher who raised sheep and cattle on his land until 1865, when he sold it to Lewis
						Moulton, an American businessman who expanded the ranch to over 19,000 acres.</p>
					<p>
						In 1959, the Laguna Niguel Corporation was founded by Cabot, Cabot and Forbes, a real estate
						company that aimed to develop one of the first master-planned communities in California. They
						hired Victor Gruen and Associates, a renowned urban planning firm, to create a detailed
						community plan for the 7,100-acre site. The plan envisioned a balanced and sustainable community
						that would preserve the natural beauty and open space of the area, while providing residential,
						commercial, recreational, and educational facilities for the residents. The plan also included a
						network of parks and trails, a civic center, a regional shopping mall and a lake.</p>
					<p>
						The first land sales in Laguna Niguel began in 1961, with the Monarch Bay and Laguna Terrace
						subdivisions. The development of the community continued throughout the 1960s and 1970s,
						attracting more homebuyers and businesses to the area. In 1971, Avco Community Developer
						acquired the Laguna Niguel Plan from the Laguna Niguel Corporation and continued to implement it
						according to the original vision. By 1980, Laguna Niguel had a population of about 12,000
						people.</p>
					<p>
						In the 1980s, Laguna Niguel residents began to express their desire for local governance and
						control over their community affairs. They formed a Community Services District in 1986, which
						provided some municipal services such as street lighting, landscaping, and animal control. In
						1989, after a successful campaign by the Laguna Niguel Cityhood Committee, Laguna Niguel
						residents voted overwhelmingly to incorporate it as a city. On December 1, 1989, Laguna Niguel
						became the 29th city in Orange County.</p>
					<p>
						Today, Laguna Niguel is a thriving and prosperous city with a population of over 64,000 people.
						It is known for its mild coastal climate, low crime rate and high quality of life. It has over
						one-third of its land designated as open space, which includes two county regional parks,
						several neighborhood parks, a dog park, and a skate park. It also has a variety of cultural and
						recreational amenities, such as the Sea Country Senior and Community Center, the Crown Valley
						Community Park and Pool, the Niguel Botanical Preserve, and the Laguna Niguel Regional Lake.
						Laguna Niguel is proud of its history and heritage and continues to strive for excellence as a
						model master-planned community.</p>
