					<h2>History</h2>
					<p>The area that is now Laguna Hills was originally inhabited by the Acjachemen Native Americans,
						who called
						it Niguili. They lived in villages along the creeks and springs, hunting, fishing, and gathering
						plants
						for food and medicine. The Acjachemen were one of the first peoples to encounter the Spanish
						explorers
						and missionaries who arrived in California in the 18th century.</p>
					<p>The Spanish established Mission San Juan Capistrano in 1776 and began to convert and enslave the
						Acjachemen. The mission lands included the area of Laguna Hills, which was part of a large ranch
						called
						Rancho Niguel. The ranch was granted to Juan Avila in 1842, after Mexico gained independence
						from Spain.
						Avila was a prominent Californio who owned several other ranches in Southern California.</p>
					<p>Avila's Rancho Niguel was one of the largest and most prosperous ranches in Orange County,
						covering over
						13,000 acres of land. He raised cattle, horses and sheep, and grew wheat, barley, and grapes. He
						also
						built a large adobe house on a hill overlooking the ranch, which still stands today as a
						historical
						landmark.</p>
					<p>Avila's family-owned Rancho Niguel until 1865, when they sold it to Lewis Moulton and Jean Pierre
						Daguerre, two American businessmen who expanded the ranching operations. They also leased some
						of their
						land to farmers who grew crops such as oranges, lemons, and walnuts. Moulton and Daguerre's
						partnership
						lasted until 1895, when Moulton bought out Daguerre's share and became the sole owner of Rancho
						Niguel.
					</p>
					<p>Moulton continued to run Rancho Niguel until his death in 1938. His daughter, Louise Moulton
						Hanson,
						inherited the ranch and managed it with her husband Lewis Hanson. They faced many challenges
						during
						their tenure, such as droughts, floods, fires and economic depressions. They also witnessed the
						rapid
						urbanization of Orange County, as more people moved to the area after World War II.</p>
					<p>In 1959, Louise Hanson sold part of Rancho Niguel to Cabot, Cabot and Forbes, a real estate
						development
						company that planned to build a master-planned community called Laguna Niguel. The community was
						designed to include residential neighborhoods, commercial centers, parks and schools. It also
						incorporated some of the historical features of Rancho Niguel, such as the adobe house and some
						of the
						original roads and trails.</p>
					<p>Laguna Niguel became one of the first planned communities in California, and attracted many
						residents who
						were looking for a suburban lifestyle with scenic views and amenities. However, some residents
						were
						dissatisfied with the governance of Laguna Niguel by the county and wanted more local control
						over their
						affairs. They formed a movement to incorporate Laguna Niguel as a city.</p>
					<p>The incorporation movement faced opposition from some neighboring communities, such as Laguna
						Hills and
						Aliso Viejo, which feared losing tax revenue and services from Laguna Niguel. They also wanted
						to
						incorporate themselves as separate cities. After several years of negotiations and lawsuits, a
						compromise was reached that allowed Laguna Niguel to incorporate in 1989, while Laguna Hills and
						Aliso
						Viejo would follow suit in 1991.</p>
					<p>Laguna Hills became the 30th city in Orange County on December 20th, 1991. The city boundaries
						included
						parts of Rancho Niguel that were not annexed by Laguna Niguel, as well as parts of other
						neighboring
						communities such as Mission Viejo and Lake Forest. The city adopted its name from Laguna Canyon
						Road
						(now Alicia Parkway), which runs through its center.</p>
					<p>Since its incorporation, Laguna Hills has developed into a thriving city with a population of
						over 30,000
						people (as of 2010). The city offers a variety of services and facilities for its residents and
						visitors, such as parks, trails, libraries, museums, and shopping centers. The city also hosts
						several
						events throughout the year, such as the annual Memorial Day Half Marathon and the Fourth of July
						Celebration.</p>
					<p>Laguna Hills is a city that celebrates its rich history and heritage, while also embracing its
						modern and
						diverse culture. It is a city that strives to provide a high quality of life for its people,
						while also
						preserving its natural beauty and environment. It is a city that is proud of its past, present,
						and
						future.</p>
