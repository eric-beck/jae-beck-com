			<h1>Rancho Santa Margarita, California</h1>
			<p>
				Rancho Santa Margarita derives its name from a Mexican land grant that was given by Governor Juan
				Alvarado in 1841 to Andr√©s Pico and Pio Pico, two brothers who were prominent figures in the Californio
				era. The grant, called Rancho Santa Margarita y Las Flores, covered a large area along the Pacific
				coast, including what is now Camp Pendleton and San Onofre State Beach. However, the city of Rancho
				Santa Margarita is not located within the boundaries of the original grant, but rather within another
				land grant called Rancho Mission Viejo, which was also given by Alvarado in 1841 to John Forster, an
				English immigrant who married Pio Pico's sister-in-law. Forster later sold his share of Rancho Mission
				Viejo to James L. Flood and Jerome O'Neill, two wealthy businessmen from San Francisco, who combined it
				with Rancho Santa Margarita y Las Flores to form a huge estate that was run as a working ranch until the
				1920s.

					<h2>History</h2>
					<p>
						In 1940, the Flood family sold their portion of the ranch to the U.S. Navy for use as Camp
						Joseph H. Pendleton, a major Marine Corps base. The O'Neill family retained the upper portion of
						the ranch, which included the area that is now Rancho Santa Margarita. In 1948 and 1963, they
						donated some of their land to the County of Orange for park purposes, creating O'Neill Regional
						Park and Caspers Wilderness Park. In 1963, they also founded the Mission Viejo Company, a real
						estate developer that planned and built the master-planned community of Mission Viejo, one of
						the first of its kind in California.
					</p>
					<p>
						By the 1960s, there were already some rural homes in Trabuco Canyon, an area within Rancho Santa
						Margarita. The first tract development in the area was Coto de Caza, which started out as a
						hunting and fishing resort in 1968 and later became a gated community. Other developments
						followed in the 1980s and 1990s, such as Dove Canyon, Robinson Ranch, Wagon Wheel, and Trabuco
						Highlands. The area became more accessible in 1992, when extensions of Oso Parkway, Antonio
						Parkway, and Alicia Parkway were completed.
					</p>
					<p>
						In 1989, the residents of Rancho Santa Margarita established a Community Civic Association (CCA)
						to provide a political voice for the community. The CCA later became the Rancho Margarita Civic
						Association (RMCA) and then the Civic Council. In 1995, a separate group called the RSM Cityhood
						Committee began the official drive for incorporation as a city. After a successful petition
						drive and a vote by the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO), a cityhood election was held
						on November 3, 1999. The voters approved cityhood by a margin of 86% to 14%, making Rancho Santa
						Margarita the 33rd city in Orange County. The city was officially incorporated on January 1,
						2000.
					</p>
					<p>
						Rancho Santa Margarita is a general law city and operates under the council-manager form of
						government. The city council consists of five members elected at-large to four-year terms. The
						mayor and mayor pro tem are chosen by the council from among its members. The city manager is
						appointed by the council and serves as the chief administrative officer of the city. The city
						contracts with the Orange County Sheriff's Department for police services and with the Orange
						County Fire Authority for fire protection services.
					</p>
					<p>
						Rancho Santa Margarita is located on a high plateau known as Plano Trabuco, at an elevation of
						about 925 feet above sea level. It covers an area of about 13 square miles. The city is bordered
						by Trabuco Canyon to the north and east, Coto de Caza and Las Flores to the south, and Mission
						Viejo and Lake Forest to the west. The city's most prominent landmark is Santiago Peak, which is
						visible from most parts of the city and has an elevation of 5,689 feet.
					</p>
					<p>
						Rancho Santa Margarita has a Mediterranean climate with warm summers and mild winters. The
						average high temperature in July is about 85 degrees Fahrenheit and the average low temperature
						in January is about 42 degrees Fahrenheit. The city receives about 15 inches of rainfall per
						year, mostly between November and March. The city is also prone to wildfires, especially during
