					<h2>History</h2>
					<p>
						The history of San Juan Capistrano, California, is a fascinating story of how a small Spanish
						mission became a thriving city with a rich cultural heritage. San Juan Capistrano was founded in
						1776 by Father Junipero Serra, who established a chain of missions along the California coast.
						The mission was named after Saint John of Capistrano, a 15th-century Franciscan friar and
						reformer. The mission was built on the site of an ancient Acjachemen village called Sajavit,
						which means "place of the water". The Acjachemen people, also known as Juane√±o, were the
						original inhabitants of the area and had a complex society and culture.
					</p>
					<p>
						The mission was intended to convert the native people to Christianity and teach them Spanish
						skills and trades. However, the mission also brought diseases, conflicts, and hardships to the
						Acjachemen people, who suffered from epidemics, forced labor and displacement. Many of them died
						or left their ancestral lands. The mission also faced attacks from other native groups, such as
						the Kumeyaay and the Yuma, who resisted the Spanish invasion.
					</p>
					<p>
						Despite these challenges, the mission prospered and became an important center of agriculture,
						industry, and education in Alta California. The mission was famous for its architecture,
						especially its stone church, which was completed in 1806 after nine years of construction. The
						church was considered one of the finest examples of Spanish colonial architecture in North
						America and was adorned with paintings, sculptures, and bells. The mission also had a large
						quadrangle with workshops, storerooms, living quarters and gardens. The mission produced crops
						such as wheat, corn, grapes, and olives, as well as livestock such as cattle, sheep, and horses.
						The mission also had a school, a library, and a printing press.
					</p>
					<p>
						The mission's golden age ended in 1812, when a massive earthquake destroyed the stone church and
						killed forty people who were attending mass. The church was never rebuilt and remained in ruins
						for over a century. The mission also declined after Mexico gained independence from Spain in
						1821 and secularized the missions in 1833. The mission lands were divided and sold to private
						owners, who used them for ranching and farming. The mission buildings were neglected and
						vandalized.
					</p>
					<p>
						The mission's revival began in 1865, when President Abraham Lincoln returned the mission to the
						Catholic Church. The Mission was restored by Father O'Sullivan in the early 20th century, who
						also invited some of the surviving Acjachemen people to return to their ancestral home. The
						mission became a popular tourist attraction and a historical landmark. The mission also became
						famous for its annual return of the swallows, which are migratory birds that nest in the
						mission's walls every spring.
					</p>
					<p>
						Today, San Juan Capistrano is a city of about 36,000 people that preserves its historical legacy
						and celebrates its diverse culture. The city has many attractions, such as the Mission San Juan
						Capistrano Museum, the Los Rios Historic District, the San Juan Capistrano Depot, and the San
						Juan Capistrano Regional Library. The city also hosts many events and festivals, such as the
						Swallows Day Parade, the Battle of the Mariachis Festival, and the Rancho Mission Viejo Rodeo.
						San Juan Capistrano is a place where history meets modernity and where tradition meets
						innovation.
